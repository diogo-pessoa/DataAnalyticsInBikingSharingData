    \section*{Problem Description}
    \label{sec:ProblemDescription}
    Bike ride-sharing apps confront the challenge of optimising bike availability across their stations, a dilemma that intensifies near tourist attractions and along commuter routes.
    Chiariotti et al.(2018)\cite{s18020512} underscore the significant imbalance within the system,
    particularly the rapid depletion of bicycles at residential stations in the morning and congestion at commercial area stations.

    This report systematically examines bike share trip records from the publicly sourced Divvy bike share system~\cite{DataSource}.
    By deriving and exploring additional features from historical trip data, this study aims to uncover trends in user behaviours regarding bike collection and return.
    It employs clustering and classification techniques to build predictive models, addressing key questions to boost operational efficiency: Which stations face the highest demand,
    and how do these patterns change throughout the day?
    Are there clear trends in user destination preferences, and when do stations experience peak activity?
    This investigation also identifies periods requiring urgent bike redistribution to meet high demand and defines `peak hours` based on empirical data analysis.

    \section*{Dataset description}
    \label{sec:dataset}

    This dataset provides anonymised historic trip data from the Divvy bike-sharing service, detailing user travel patterns across various stations and times.
    It captures the dynamics of bike usage, offering insights into the frequency and distribution of trips.
    Our analysis primarily focuses on the start and end stations' IDs to identify which stations require re-stocking and to infer the most popular destinations.
    Additionally, correlating trip start and end times with station usage is essential for a comprehensive understanding.\newline

    The dataset includes the following key features:\newline

    \subsection{Dataset Features}\label{subsec:dataset-features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{star\_ride\_id}: A unique identifier for each trip, ensuring individual trips can be tracked and analyzed discretely.
        \item \textbf{star\_rideable\_type}: The type of bike used for the trip, which can influence usage patterns and availability needs.
        \item \textbf{star\_started\_at}: The timestamp indicating when a trip started, crucial for understanding demand over time.
        \item \textbf{star\_ended\_at}: The timestamp indicating when a trip ended, allowing for the calculation of trip duration and temporal patterns of bike usage.
        \item \textbf{star\_start\_station\_name}: The name of the station where the trip originated, providing a geographic point for demand analysis.
        \item \textbf{star\_start\_station\_id}: A unique identifier for the origin station, which can be used in conjunction with geographic data for mapping and spatial analysis.
        \item \textbf{star\_end\_station\_name}: The name of the station where the trip concluded, indicating the destination demand in the network.
        \item \textbf{star\_end\_station\_id}: A unique identifier for the destination station, useful for spatial analysis and redistribution strategies.
        \item \textbf{star\_start\_lat \& start\_lng}: The latitude and longitude of the start station, giving precise location data for origin points.
        \item \textbf{star\_end\_lat \& end\_lng}: The latitude and longitude of the end station, giving precise location data for destination points.
        \item \textbf{star\_member\_casual}: A categorization of the user as a member or a casual rider, which can influence riding patterns and frequency of use.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Added Features}\label{subsec:added-features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{week\_day\_index}: Categorised into Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night, to analyse demand fluctuations.
        \item \textbf{day\_period\_index}: Classified into working and non-working days, to observe weekly patterns in bike usage.
    \end{itemize}

    While the focus is not on text processing, storing text-based features like station names and user types enriches data visualisation, making it more accessible and interpretable.
    This approach, although not critical for data model training, enhances the user experience during data exploration.\newline
    \newline\textbf{Importance of Accessibility:}\newline
    A dataset's value is significantly enhanced by its accessibility.
    By detailing and explaining the dataset's features, this report aims to ensure that the data is as useful and informative as possible for the intended analysis.

    \section*{Method}
    \label{sec:method}

    \subsection{Data Acquisition}\label{subsec:data-acquisition}

     The initial phase involves acquiring data from the source.
    The initial phase involves acquiring data from the source.
    By scraping the endpoint available, using a notebook environment to automate the process of scraping.
    Then, downloading and unzipping, and storing the data files programmatically.
    For the purposes of this proposal, the data is stored in a conventional file storage system and subsequently loaded as a CSV file.

     \subsection{Data Preparation}\label{subsec:data-preparation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The subsequent step involves the pre-processing and cleaning of the dataset, which includes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Standardizing features by converting string data types to numeric where necessary.
            \item Scaling the dataset to normalize features for model training, where applicable.
            \item Addressing null values either by imputation or by dropping subsets of data. It depends on the significance of the feature in question.
            \item Removing irrelevant features that do not contribute to the research questions at hand.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Feature engineering}\label{subsec:feature-engineering}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item During the pre-processing. Add enrich the dataset by adding a categorical 'date' feature.
        Segmenting trip times into periods (e.g., morning, afternoon, night). \newline This early inclusion is strategic.
